UNION FIND

Description: 
  Union Find is a data structure used to dynamically find disjoint set. 

Functions included: 
1. findSet($i) -> used to get the parent of an instance 

2. isSameSet($i, $j) -> used to return TRUE if they are on the same set, and FALSE if not.

3. unionSet($i, $j) -> used to union two set

4. numDisjointSets() -> returning the number of disjoint set

5. sizeOfSet($i) -> returning the size of each set. It's used in the path compression of UnionFind.
